# whole_genome_alignments

Contains the pipeline I used to create whole genome alignments between Fusarium oxysporum genomes. This is in 2014, using version of MUMmer (MUMMer3.23) and python (2.6 or 2.7) that were curent at that time.

This is placed here as a surplus for the Materials and Methods in the paper [insert ref once published :-)], not as working standalone code or anything. Maybe later.

I used presence_absence_plots in genome-wide_lots to visualize results.
